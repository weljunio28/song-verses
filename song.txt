You know what they say
Life ain't always easy and every day
We're survivors
So forget the day
It's all about tonight; act a fool and start a riot, a-riot, be a rebel

Yo, similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how the top feels
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
Lot of them try to do it, but it's not real
Wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
White curls in a hot pink Hot Wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives
You wink, it goes by
So we'll just get it with no edits
Anything goes, so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy
And let's just get right
Young money, cash money in the building
Let's go, the world ends tonight
